## Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (NNSP)

This repository describes the contents learned in NNSP by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. 
The final deep learning projects are provided to be run in both command line and in Jupyter Notebook.
Two deep learning models are included, a NNSP classifier model and a regression model.

The data to test, train and run the models was provided by the NNSP's authors. 
If interested in getting the book, (highly recommend it if you are new to machine learning!) https://nnfs.io/.

Enjoy!!!
