# NNSPy
## Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (NNSP)

This repository describes the contents learned in NNSP by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. 
The final deep learning projects code were modified to be run in command line rather than in Jupyter Notebook.
Two deep learning models are included, a NNSP classifier model and a regression model, both learned in NNSP.

The data to test, train and run the models was provided by the NNSP's authors. 
If interested in getting the book, (highly recommend it if you are new in machine learning!) https://nnfs.io/.

Enjoy!!!
