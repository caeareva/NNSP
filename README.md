# NNSPy
## Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (NNSP)

This repository describes the contents learned in NNSP by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. 
The final projects code were modified to be run in command line rather than in Jupyter Notebook.
Two models are included, a NNSP classifier model and a regression model, both learned in NNSP.

Enjoy!!!
