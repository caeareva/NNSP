## Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (NNSP)

Repository describes the conceps learned from NNSP by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. 
The final deep learning projects are provided to be run in both command line and Jupyter Notebook.
Three deep learning models are included, a NNSP classifier model, a regression model and an prediction/inference 
model.

The data to test, train and run the models was provided by the NNSP's authors. The inference model uses the 
Fashion MNIST dataset (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). The Fashion MNIST dataset is a 
collection of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of 28x28 images of 10 various clothing items
like shoes, boots, shirts, bags, and more.
